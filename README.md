### About Timefold (formerly OptaPlanner)

You might remember OptaPlanner, a metaheuristics constraints-based solver, started by [Geoffrey De Smet](https://github.com/ge0ffrey) and matured under the wings of Red Hat. 
Geoffrey De Smet, myself and many of the original OptaPlanner team are now continuing the project as [Timefold Solver](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver). 
Why OptaPlanner continues as Timefold can be read in our fork message on [our blog](https://timefold.ai/blog/2023/optaplanner-fork).

Our [Timefold Solver repo](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver) and [Quickstarts](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts) repos are here to help developers like you solve intricate planning puzzles. 
From route optimization to shift scheduling, we're dedicated to empowering you to build smarter, more optimized software.

🌟 Thanks in advance for starring the [Timefold Solver repo](https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver).
